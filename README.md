### Design

The design of the site is based on standard Materialize elements, with their colouring altered to be bright and colorful. Bug Reports and Feature Requests are displayed as cards, showing a brief summary of the ticket along with information on how many views and favourites that each has.

#### Framework

Frameworks used in the project are:

- [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
    - Used to simplify the building of a responsive website.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - To simplify DOM manipulation.

#### Color Scheme

The site uses easy to look at, contrasting colors. A green navbar, brown footer, red icons and blue buttons of varying shades.

#### Typography

The Google font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) has been used for titles and main headings.
